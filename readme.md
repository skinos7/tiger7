# brief 
The research and development of Internet edge computing based on Linux operating system makes innovative changes in both software and hardware to meet the diversified and complex needs of the market
- Software-based development of the **Software Foundation Development Platform**, which encapsulates embedded hardware in a unified way, providing a unified and scalable interface upwards 
- In terms of hardware, we develop highly integrated and interface-rich **routing modules** or **edge computing gateway modules**, and develop targeted routing products and terminal computing products based on modules 



# hardware product
The routing module is embedded in the customer's device or product to help it access the Internet and complete the calculation of business data related conversion and forwarding, triggering, timing task and so on  
- **LTE routing module**, **D218**
Provide LTE(4G) access, 2.4g WIFI(300M dual antenna) access or coverage, Ethernet (100M) access or out of the multi-functional and highly extensible routing module, and with double serial port (RS485/RS232/TTL three modes), multi-channel IO port and the corresponding data conversion and forwarding computing capabilities,  And provide a complete SDK and development interface, SDK has integrated a variety of control protocols can help developers to achieve local and remote control of this module  

- **NR(5G) routing module**, **D228**
Provide NR(5G) and LTE(4G) access, 5.8G WIFI(800M dual antenna) access or coverage, Ethernet (1000M) access or out of the multi-functional and highly extensible routing module,  And with three serial ports (RS485/RS232/TTL), multi-channel IO port and the corresponding data conversion and forwarding and other computing capabilities, and provides a complete SDK and development interface, SDK has integrated a variety of control protocols can help developers to achieve local and remote control of the module  

- **NR(5G)&WIFI6 gateway module**, **D618**
Provide NR(5G) and LTE(4G) access, 5.8G WIFI6(1200M dual antenna) access or coverage, Ethernet (1000M) access or lead to the multi-functional and highly scalable routing module, with Bluetooth 5.0, CAN interface, HDMI2.0 audio and video output,  Audio input and output, MIPI-CSI camera head interface, USB2.0 interface (TYPE C), three serial ports (RS485/RS232/TTL), multi-channel IO interface and corresponding data conversion and forwarding and other computing capabilities, and provide a complete SDK and development interface,  SDK has integrated a variety of control protocols to help developers to achieve local and remote control of this module  



# Software base development platform
Using the functions provided by the Linux operating system, the various resources of embedded hardware are packaged into a relatively uniform development environment  
Strive to insert a development environment middle layer between embedded hardware and embedded software  
Stripping out development in two directions:
 - **Development environment** development: porting more embedded hardware platforms, packaging more hardware resources, providing more apis  
 - **Development of embedded application software** : based on the API provided by the development environment to develop more application logic, and application logic can also be convenient to provide interfaces to other applications in the way of API, all kinds of application logic can be very convenient to superimpose each other, to meet the various individual needs of customers  

Through the above means, the embedded application software developed based on the development environment has the following advantagesï¼š
- It can be transplanted to any embedded hardware platform supported by this development environment without code level modification, changing the status quo of repeated development and transplantation or adaptation in embedded  
- It is very convenient to provide various call interfaces externally
- Directly implement the corresponding management configuration or call its interface based on the protocol provided by the system  
- And save the r&d cost in the future update of embedded chip
